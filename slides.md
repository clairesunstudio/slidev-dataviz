# The Art of Data Visualization

<Credit />

<!-- You might recognize this as a piece of art and design - the album cover of the "Unknown Pleasures" by Joy Division. It has been widely imitated and referenced in pop culture and fashion. But it's actually driven by scientic data. It was a dataviz created by radio astronomer Harold Craft in 1970. The lines are data measures of radio waves emitted by a pulsar, a type of rotating neutron star. Because it was popularized by the design of the albumn cover, some people call this type of chart "joyplot". Graphic designer, Peter Saville, has turned it into a pop art icon. I chose this to be the cover image for this class because I think this is a great symbol of Data visualization - an interdisciplinary field between art and science and a statement that data can be beautiful. -->

<!-- Previous title - I built several interactive data reports and data stories for the public to help present data made available by different state departments. I will draw on some examples from the dataviz that I built throughout the course. 

Data visualization is a cross-disciplinary field that draws upon concepts and techniques from various domains - it combines scientific rigor, design thinking and good eye for design to create something that's efficient, accurate, impactful, visually appealing and user-friendly. Some of you might have background in statistics, design, computer programming, and this is a subject that requires us to become a little more all-rounded; and for some of you that don't have these backgrounds, hopefull this will introduce you into dataviz or the related fields.

# About This Class

**Goal**: Learn fundamental concepts and design principles, through case studies, demos and exercises, gain hands-on skills to create dynamic data visualizations that follow best design practices. Students can continue to explore on their own and create their next dataviz beyond this class. 
- **Schedule**: Meeting 6:30-9:00pm every Tuesday night (7 weeks)
- **Grading**: P/F
- **Reading**: All reading will be provided, no purchase required
- **Applications**: Observable, and Illustrator or Figma (optional)
- **Prerequisites**: None (Basic Javascript knowledge preferred)
- [Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wNakUIx7uloN2_17R4Xqoy196lmVDqsB2q54mnba8Og/edit)

<!-- This is an introductory class and hopefully a gateway for you to practice and learn more on your own.

We are going to learn some necessary Javascript. The reason why I chose to teach this class using Javascript and Observable (more on the tool later) - I'm a big proponent for open source projects. If you are in the field, you are likely be using some expensive BI tools from big corps - Tableau, Power BI, Looker to name a few - they are expensive and inflexible. You lose access to your work when you are no longer paying for them. Learning Javascript will make your skills more transferable, adaptable, there's no limit what you can create. 

Please note that the syllabus is a living doc, I will make adjustments as we go based on our pace and our needs. -->
