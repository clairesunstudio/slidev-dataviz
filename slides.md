# The Art of Data Visualization

<Credit />

<!-- Why I chose this to be the cover image? You might recognize this as a piece of art and design - the album cover of the "Unknown Pleasures" by Joy Division. It has been widely imitated and referenced in pop culture and fashion. But it's actually driven by scientic data. It was a dataviz created by radio astronomer Harold Craft in 1970. The lines are data measures of radio waves emitted by a pulsar, a type of rotating neutron star. Because it was popularized by the design of the albumn cover, some people call this type of chart "joyplot". Graphic designer, Peter Saville, has turned it into a pop art icon. I think this is a great symbol of Data visualization - an interdisciplinary field between art and science and a statement: data can be beautiful. -->
