- 👩🏻‍💻 Senior UX Designer and Design System Lead @ Massachusetts Digital Service
- 📊 Previously Data Visualization Engineer

<!-- Previous title - I built several interactive data reports and data stories to help present data to the public made available by various state departments. I will draw on some examples from the dataviz that I built throughout the course. 

My academic background is in math and graphic design. Data visualization is a cross-disciplinary field - it requires scientific rigor, design thinking and a good eye for design to create something that's accurate, informative, impactful, and engaging.

# The Art of Data Visualization

<Credit />

<!-- Do you recognize this graphic? It's an album cover for the band Joy Division. It has been widely imitated and referenced in pop culture and fashion - you probably wonder what it means. It was a dataviz created by radio astronomer Harold Craft in his PHD dissertation in the 70s. The lines are data measures of radio waves emitted by a pulsar, a type of rotating neutron star. Because it was popularized by the design of the albumn cover, some people call this type of chart "joyplot". Graphic designer, Peter Saville, has turned it into a pop art classic. I chose this to be the cover image for this class because I think this is a great symbol of Data visualization - an interdisciplinary field between art and science and that data can look beautiful. -->

# About This Class

**Goal**: Learn fundamental concepts and design principles, through case studies, demos and exercises, gain hands-on skills to create dynamic data visualizations that follow best design practices. Students can continue to explore on their own and create their next dataviz beyond this class. 
- **Schedule**: Meeting 6:30-9:00pm every Tuesday night (7 weeks)
- **Grading**: P/F
- **Reading**: All reading will be provided, no purchase required
- **Applications**: Observable, and Illustrator or Figma (optional)
- **Prerequisites**: None (Basic Javascript knowledge preferred)
- [Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wNakUIx7uloN2_17R4Xqoy196lmVDqsB2q54mnba8Og/edit)

<!-- This is an introductory class and hopefully a gateway for you to practice and learn more on your own.

We are going to learn some necessary Javascript. The reason why I chose to teach this class using Javascript and Observable (more on the tool later) - I'm a big proponent for open source projects. If you are in the field, you are likely be using some expensive BI tools Tableau, Power BI, Looker to name a few - they can be expensive and inflexible. Learning Javascript will make your skills more transferable, adaptable, there's no limit what you can create once you master it. In this class, we are just going to dabble into it and learn enough be dangerous so that you can start hacking some examples and visualize your own data.

Please note that the syllabus is a living doc, I will make adjustments as we go based on our pace and our needs. -->
