## Line Graph

<img src="http://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/images/top_images/line_graph.png" style="max-height: 100%" />

- Functions: Patterns,Data over time,Comparisons
- Related Dataviz: Area Graph,Stacked Area Graph

<!--

This chart is used to display quantitative values over a continuous interval or time period. A Line Graph is most frequently used to show trends and analyse how the data has changed over time.Line Graphs are drawn by first plotting data points on a Cartesian coordinate grid, and then connecting a line between all of these points. Typically, the y-axis has a quantitative value, while the x-axis is a timescale or a sequence of intervals. Negative values can be displayed below the x-axis.The direction of the lines on the graph works as a nice metaphor for the data: an upward slope indicates where values have increased and a downward slope indicates where values have decreased. The line's journey across the graph can create patterns that reveal trends in a dataset.  When grouped with other lines (other data series), individual lines can be compared to one another. However, avoid using more than 3-4 lines per graph, as this makes the chart more cluttered and harder to read. A solution to this is to divide the chart into smaller multiples (have a small Line Graph for each data series).

- Functions: Patterns,Data over time
- Related Dataviz: Line Graph,Stacked Area Graph

<!--

Area Graphs are Line Graphs but with the area below the line filled in with a certain colour or texture. Area Graphs are drawn by first plotting data points on a Cartesian coordinate grid, joining a line between the points and  finally filling in the space below the completed line.Like Line Graphs, Area Graphs are used to display the development of quantitative values over an interval or time period. They are most commonly used to show trends, rather than convey specific values.Two popular variations of Area Graphs are: grouped and Stacked Area Graphs. Grouped Area Graphs start from the same zero axis, while Stacked Area Graphs have each data series start from the point left by the previous data series.More Area Graph variations in this blog post.

Stacked Area Graphs work the same way as simple Area Graphs, except for displaying multiple data series that start each point from the point left by the previous data series.The entire graph represents the total of all the data plotted. Stacked Area Graphs also use the areas to convey whole numbers, so they do not work for negative values. Overall, they are useful for comparing multiple variables changing over time.

- Functions: Data over time,Patterns
- Related Dataviz: Stacked Area Graph

<!--

Also known as a ThemeRiver.This visualisation is a variation of a Stacked Area Graph, but instead of plotting values against a fixed, straight axis, a Stream Graph has values displaced around a varying central baseline. Stream Graphs display the changes in data over time of different categories through flowing, organic shapes that somewhat resemble a river-like stream. This makes Stream Graphs aesthetically pleasing and more engaging.  In a Stream Graph, the size of each stream shape is proportional to the values in each category. The axis that a Stream Graph flows parallel to, is used for the timescale. Colour can be used to either distinguish each category or to visualise an additional quantitative variable by varying the colour shade.  Stream Graphs are ideal for displaying high-volume datasets to discover trends and patterns changing over time across a range of different categories. For example, seasonal peaks and troughs in the stream shape can suggest a periodic pattern. A Stream Graph could also be used to visualise the volatility over time for a large group of assets.  The downside to Stream Graphs is that they suffer from legibility issues, as they are often very cluttered with large datasets. The categories with smaller values are often drowned out to make way for categories with much larger values, making it impossible to see all the data. Also, it's impossible to read the exact values visualised in a Stream Graph, as there is no value axis to use as a reference.  Therefore, Stream Graphs should be reserved for audiences who don’t intend to spend much time deciphering the graph and exploring its data. Stream Graphs are better for giving a more general view of the data. They also tend to work significantly better as interactive pieces rather than static or printed graphics.

## Density Plot

<!--

Also known as a Kernel Density Plot or Density Trace Graph.A Density Plot visualises the distribution of data over a continuous interval or time period. This chart is a variation of a Histogram that uses kernel smoothing to plot values, allowing for smoother distributions by smoothing out the noise. The peaks of a Density Plot help display where values are concentrated over the interval.  An advantage Density Plots have over Histograms is that they're better at determining the distribution shape because they're not affected by the number of bins used (each bar used in a typical histogram).  A Histogram comprising of only 4 bins wouldn't produce a distinguishable enough shape of distribution as a 20-bin Histogram would. However, with Density Plots, this isn't an issue.

Instead, Bar Chart's discrete data is categorical and therefore answers the question of "how many?" in each category.More Bar Chart variations in this blog post.

<!--

Unlike a Multiset Bar Graph which displays the bars side-by-side for multiple data series, Stacked Bar Graphs segment the bars on top of each other. They are used to show how a larger category is divided into smaller subcategories and what the relationship of each part has on the total amount. There are two types of Stacked Bar Graphs:Simple Stacked Bar Graphs place each value for the segment after the previous one. The total value of the bar is all the segment values added together. Ideal for comparing the total amounts across each segmented bar.100% Stack Bar Graphs show the percentage-of-the-whole by plotting the percentage of each value to the total amount in each group. This makes it easier to see the relative differences between quantities in each group.One major flaw of Stacked Bar Graphs is that they become harder to read the more segments each bar has. Also, comparing each segment to the other is difficult, as they're not aligned on a common baseline.

<!--

Also known as a Grouped Bar Chart or Clustered Bar Chart.This variation of a Bar Chart can be used when two or more data series need to be plotted all on the same axis and grouped into parent categories.Like on a Bar Chart, the length of each bar on a Multiset Bar Chart is used to show discrete, numerical comparisons amongst categories. Each bar for a data series is assigned a colour to distinguish them apart. Bars in the same group are placed together and are then spaced apart from other bar groupings.The use of Multiset Bar Charts is usually to compare across categories that contain the same sub-categorical variables between them. Each bar is a subcategory that is grouped into a larger parent category.Multiset Bar Charts can also be used to compare mini Histograms to each other, so each bar in the group would represent the significant intervals of a variable. Another use could be to use Multiset Bar Charts to show data changing over time by having, for example, each bar represent a point in time such as a year.The downside of Multiset Bar Charts is that they become harder to read the more bars you have in one group. Therefore, you should try to limit the number of bars per group.

<!--
 Also known as an Age & Sex Pyramid.A Population Pyramid is a pair of back-to-back Histograms (for each sex) that displays the distribution of a population in all age groups and both sexes. The x-axis is used to plot population numbers and the y-axis lists all age groups.Population Pyramids are ideal for detecting changes or differences in population patterns. Multiple Population Pyramids can be used to compare patterns across nations or selected population groups.The shape of a Population Pyramid can be used to interpret a population. For example, a pyramid with a very wide base and a narrow top section suggests a population with both high fertility and death rates. Whereas, a pyramid with a wider top half and a narrower base would suggest an ageing population with low fertility rates.Population Pyramids can also be used to speculate a population’s future development. An ageing population that is not reproducing would eventually run into issues such as having enough offspring to care for the elderly. Other theories such as the “Youth Bulge” state that when there’s a wide bulge around the 16-30 age range, particularly in males, this leads to social unrest, war and terrorism.This makes Population Pyramids useful for fields such as Ecology, Sociology and Economics.

<!--

Extensively used in presentations and offices, Pie Charts help show proportions and percentages between categories, by dividing a circle into proportional segments. Each arc length represents a proportion of each category, while the full circle represents the total sum of all the data, equal to 100%.Pie Charts are ideal for giving the reader a quick idea of the proportional distribution of the data. However, the major downsides to pie charts are:They cannot show more than a few values, because as the number of values shown increases, the size of each segment/slice becomes smaller. This makes them unsuitable for large datasets with many categories.  They take up more space than their alternatives, for example, a 100% Stacked Bar Chart. Mainly due to their size and the usual need for a legend.  They are not great for making accurate comparisons between groups of Pie Charts. This is because it is harder to distinguish the size of items via area when it is for length.Despite that, comparing a given category (one slice) within the total of a single Pie Chart, then it can often be more effective.

A Donut Chart is essentially a Pie Chart but with the area of the centre cut out.  However, Donut Charts have a slight advantage over Pie Charts, which are sometimes criticised for focusing on the relative sizes of the pieces to one another and to the chart as a whole, giving no indication of changes as a whole when compared to other Pie Charts.  A Donut Chart partly addresses this problem by de-emphasising the use of area, to make the viewer focus more on the changes in overall values. You are focused on reading the length of the arcs, rather than comparing the proportions between slices.  Also, Donut Charts are more space-efficient than Pie Charts because the blank space inside a Donut Chart can be used to display information inside it.

<!--

Treemaps are an alternative way of visualising the hierarchical structure of a Tree Diagram while also displaying quantities for each category via area size. Each category is assigned a rectangle area with the subcategory rectangles nested inside.  When a quantity is assigned to a category, its area size is in proportion to that quantity and any other quantities within the same parent category in a part-to-whole relationship. Also, the area size of the parent category is the total of its subcategories. If no quantity has been assigned to a subcategory, then its area is divided equally amongst the other subcategories within the parent category.The way rectangles are divided and ordered into sub-rectangles depends on the tiling algorithm used. Many tiling algorithms have been developed, but the "squarified algorithm", which keeps each rectangle as square-like as possible is the one commonly used.Ben Shneiderman originally developed Treemaps as a way of visualising a vast file directory on a computer, without taking up too much space on the screen. This makes Treemaps a more compact and space-efficient option for displaying hierarchies, that can give a quick overview of the hierarcal structure. Treemaps are also great at comparing the proportions between categories via their area size.  The downside to Treemaps is that they doesn't show the hierarchal levels as clearly as other charts that visualise hierarchal data (such as a Tree Diagram or Sunburst Diagram).

Also known as a Circular Treemap.  Circle Packing is a variation of a Treemap that uses circles instead of rectangles. Containment within each circle represents a level in the hierarchy: each branch of the tree is represented as a circle and its sub-branches are represented as circles inside of it. The area of each circle can also be used to represent an additional arbitrary value, such as quantity or file size. Colour may also be used to assign categories or to represent another variable via different shades.  As beautiful as Circle Packing appears, it's not as space-efficient as a Treemap, as there's a lot of empty space within the circles. Despite this, Circle Packing actually reveals hierarchal structure better than a Treemap.

- Functions: Comparisons,Part-to-a-whole,Proportions,Relationships
- Related Dataviz: Stacked Bar Graph,Treemap

<!--

Also known as a Mosaic Plot.Marimekko Charts are used to visualise categorical data over a pair of variables. In a Marimekko Chart, both axes are variables with a percentage scale, that determines both the width and height of each segment. So Marimekko Charts work as a kind of two-way 100% Stacked Bar Graph. This makes it possible to detect relationships between categories and their subcategories via the two axes.The main flaws of Marimekko Charts are that they can be hard to read, especially when there are many segments. Also, it’s hard to accurately make comparisons between each segment, as they are not all arranged next to each other along a common baseline. Therefore, Marimekko Charts are better suited for giving a more general overview of the data.

- Functions: Patterns,Relationships
- Related Dataviz: Bubble Chart

<!--

Also known as a Scatter Graph, Point Graph, X-Y Plot, Scatter Chart or Scattergram.A Scatterplot places points on a Cartesian Coordinates system to display all the values between two variables. By having an axis for each variable, you can detect if a relationship or correlation between the two exists.  The kind of correlation can be interpreted through the patterns revealed on a Scatterplot. These are: positive (values increase together), negative (one value decreases as the other increases) or null (no correlation). The shape of the correlation can be described as: linear, exponential and U-shaped. The strength of the correlation can be determined by how closely packed the points are to each other on the graph. Points that end up far outside the general cluster of points are known as outliers.Lines or curves can be displayed over the graph to aid in the analysis. This is typically known as the Line of Best Fit or Trend Line and can be used to make estimates via interpolation. A Line of Best Fit is drawn as close to all the points as possible to show how it would look if all the points were condensed together into a single line.Scatterplots are ideal when you have paired numerical data and you want to see if one variable impacts the other. However, do remember that correlation is not causation and another unnoticed or indirect variable may be influencing the results.

## Bubble Chart

<img src="http://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/images/top_images/bubble_chart.png" style="max-height: 100%" />

- Functions: Comparisons,Data over time,Distribution,Patterns,Proportions,Relationships
- Related Dataviz: Proportional Area Chart,Scatterplot

<!--

A Bubble Chart is a multi-variable graph that is a cross between a Scatterplot and a Proportional Area Chart.Like a Scatterplot, Bubble Charts use a Cartesian coordinate system to plot points along a grid where the X and Y axis are separate variables. However. unlike a Scatterplot, each point is assigned a label or category (either displayed alongside or on a legend). Each plotted point then represents a third variable by the area of its circle. Colours can also be used to distinguish between categories or used to represent an additional data variable. Time can be shown either by having it as a variable on one of the axis or by animating the data variables changing over time.Bubble Charts are typically used to compare and show the relationships between categorised circles, by the use of positioning and proportions.  The overall picture of Bubble Charts can be used to analyse for patterns/correlations.Too many bubbles can make the chart hard to read, so Bubble Charts have a limited data size capacity. This can be somewhat remedied by interactivity: clicking or hovering over bubbles to display hidden information, having an option to reorganise or filter out grouped categories.Like with Proportional Area Charts, the sizes of the circles need to be drawn based on the circle’s area, not its radius or diameter. Not only will the size of the circles change exponentially, but this will lead to misinterpretations by the human visual system.

## Heatmap (Matrix)

<!--

Heatmaps visualise data through variations in colouring. When applied to a tabular format, Heatmaps are useful for cross-examining multivariate data, through placing variables in the rows and columns and colouring the cells within the table. Heatmaps are good for showing variance across multiple variables, revealing any patterns, displaying whether any variables are similar to each other, and for detecting if any correlations exist.Typically, all the rows are one category (labels displayed on the left or right side) and all the columns are another category (labels displayed on the top or bottom). The individual rows and columns are divided into the subcategories, which all match up with each other in a matrix. The cells are the intersections of the rows and columns, which can either contain categorical data or numerical data.A legend is required alongside a Heatmap in order for it to be successfully read. Categorical data is colour-coded, while numerical data requires a colour scale that blends from one colour to another, in order to represent the difference in high and low values. A selection of solid colours can be used to represent multiple value ranges (0-10, 11-20, 21-30, etc) or you can use a gradient scale for a single range (for example 0 - 100) by blending two or more colours together.Because of their reliance on colour to communicate values, Heatmaps are a chart better suited to displaying a more generalised view of numerical data, as it’s harder to accurately tell the differences between colour shades and to extract specific data points from. However, this problem can be remedied by displaying the data values inside the cells.Heatmaps can also be used to show the changes in data over time if one of the rows or columns are set to time intervals. An example of this would be to use a Heatmap to compare the temperature changes across the year in multiple cities, to see where’s the hottest or coldest places. So the rows could list the cities to compare, the columns contain each month and the cells would contain the temperature values.

- Functions: Comparisons,Distribution,Patterns,Proportions
- Related Dataviz: Pictogram Chart

<!--

Dot Matrix Charts display discreet data through a series of organised dots, each coloured to represent a particular category and grouped in a matrix. They are used to give a quick overview of the distribution and proportions of each category in a data set. Dot Matrix Charts are also used to compare distribution and proportion across other datasets, to discover patterns.When only one category is used in the dataset and all the dots are the same colour, a Dot Matrix Chart can be used to primarily show proportions.

Also known as Pictograph Chart, Pictorial Chart, Pictorial Unit Chart, Picture Graph.Pictogram Charts use icons to give a more engaging overall view of small sets of discrete data. Typically, the icons represent the data’s subject or category, for example, data on population would use icons of people. Each icon can represent one unit or any number of units (e.g. each icon represents 10). Data sets are compared side-by-side in either columns or rows of icons, to compare each category to one another.The use of icons can sometimes help overcome differences in language, culture and education. Icons can also give a more representational view of the data. So for example, if your data is of 5 cars, you show 5 icons of cars in the chart.Two things to avoid when using Pictogram Charts are: Using them for large data sets, which makes values on the chart hard to count.Displaying partial icons, as this can add confusion to what they represent.
