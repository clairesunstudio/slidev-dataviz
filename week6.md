# Data Maps

Data maps are usually described as "thematic maps" in cartography, because it displays spatial patterns and variations of a specific theme or topic, rather than just geographical features.

<!-- Data maps are usually described as "thematic maps" in cartography, because it displays spatial patterns and variations of a specific theme or topic, rather than just geographical features. It is designed to communicate information about a particular subject within a geographic area. Data maps use various visual elements, such as colors, symbols, and patterns, to represent data and help viewers understand spatial relationships and distributions. -->

## Final Project

- Visualize a dataset of your choice efficiently and expressively. Don't forget add context, labels, legends and interactivity!
- If you can't find any interesting datasets, you can use one of the [sample data provided by Observable](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/sample-datasets)
- For more inspirations: vist the [The Plot Gallery](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-gallery)
