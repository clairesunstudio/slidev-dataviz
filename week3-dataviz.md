<!--
 A Timeline is a graphical way of displaying a list of events in chronological order. Some Timelines work on a scale, while others simply display events in sequence.  The main function of Timelines is to communicate time-related information, either for analysis or to visually present a story or view of history.  If scale-based, a Timeline allows you to see when things occur or are to occur, by allowing the viewer to assess the time intervals between events. This allows the viewer to see any patterns appearing over any selected time period or how events are distributed in that time period.  Other forms of data visualisation can be combined with a Timeline to show how quantitative data changes over time. For example, the bars of a Span Chart could be used to show the duration of events. Here is a blog post showcasing a list of Timeline combinations. When scaled:

## Gantt Chart

<!--

Commonly used as an organisational tool for project management, Gantt Charts display a list of activities (or tasks) with their duration over time, showing when each activity starts and ends. This makes Gantt Charts useful for planning and estimating how long an entire project might take. You can also see what activities are running in parallel to each other.Gantt Charts are drawn within a table: rows are used for the activities and columns are used as the timescale. The duration of each activity is represented by the length of a bar plotted along this timescale. The start of the bar is the beginning of the activity and the end of the bar is when the activity should finish. Colour-coding the bars can be used to categorise the activities into groups. To show the percentage of completion of an activity, a bar can be partially filled in, shaded differently or use a different colour, to differentiate between what is done and what is left to do.Connecting arrows can be used to show which tasks are dependent on each other. Critical paths, the key activities required to finish the project can also be displayed with a series of highlighted arrows. Symbols can also be placed within a Gantt Chart to signify milestones and a vertical line running through the chart is used to highlight the current date.

Also known as a Time Series Spiral.This visualisation plots time-based data along an Archimedean spiral. The graph begins at the centre of the spiral and then progresses outwards. Spiral Plots are versatile and can plot bars, lines or points along the spiral path.Spiral Plots are ideal for showing large data sets, usually to show trends over a large period of time. Therefore, Spiral Plots are great for displaying periodic patterns. Colour can be assigned to each period to break them up and to allow some comparison between each period. So, for example, if we were to show data over a year, we could assign a colour for each month on the graph. - - -Papers on the development of Spiral Plots: Interactive Visualization of Serial Periodic Data - John V.

<!--

Also known as: Spider Chart, Web Chart, Polar Chart, Star Plots.Radar Charts are a way of comparing multiple quantitative variables. This makes them useful for seeing which variables have similar values or if there are any outliers amongst each variable. Radar Charts are also useful for seeing which variables are scoring high or low within a dataset, making them suited for displaying performance.Each variable is provided with an axis that starts from the centre. All axes are arranged radially, with equal distances between each other, while maintaining the same scale between all axes. Grid lines that connect from axis to axis are often used as a guide. Each variable value is plotted along an individual axis and all the variables in a dataset and connected to form a polygon.However, there are some major flaws with using Radar Charts:Having multiple polygons for each data series in one Radar Chart can make it hard to read, confusing and too cluttered. Especially if the polygons are filled in, as the top polygon covers all the other polygons underneath it. Transparency can remedy this problem, but having too many polygons will still produce a chart that is overcluttered.  Having too many variables creates too many axes and can also make the chart hard to read and complicated. So it's good practice to keep Radar Charts simple and limit the number of variables used.  Another flaw with Radar Charts is that they’re not so good for comparing values across each variable. Even with the aid of the spiderweb-like grid guide. Comparing values all on a single straight axis is much easier.

Also known as a Coxcomb Chart, Polar Area Diagram.This chart was famously used by statistician and medical reformer, Florence Nightingale to communicate the avoidable deaths of soldiers during the Crimean war.Nightingale Rose Charts are drawn on a polar coordinate grid. Each category or interval in the data is divided into equal segments on this radial chart. How far each segment extends from the centre of the polar axis depends on the value it represents. So each ring from the centre of the polar grid can be used as a scale to plot the segment size and represent a higher value.The major flaw with Nightingale Rose Charts is that the outer segments are emphasised more because of their larger area size, which disproportionately represents any value increases.

<!--

As known as a Japanese Candlestick Chart.This type of chart is used as a trading tool to visualise and analyse the price movements over time for securities, derivatives, currencies, stocks, bonds, commodities, etc.  Although the symbols used in Candlestick Charts resemble a Box Plot, they function differently and therefore, are not to be confused with one another.  Candlestick Charts display multiple bits of price information such as the open price, close price, highest price and lowest price through the use of candlestick-like symbols. Each symbol represents the compressed trading activity for a single time period (a minute, hour, day, month, etc). Each Candlestick symbol is plotted along a time scale on the x-axis, to show the trading activity over time.  The main rectangle in the symbol is known as the real body, which is used to display the range between the open and close price of that time period.  While the lines extending from the bottom and top of the real body is known as the lower and upper shadows (or wick).  Each shadow represents the highest or lowest price traded during the time period represented.  When the market is Bullish (the closing price is higher than it opened), then the body is coloured typically white or green.  But when the market is Bearish (the closing price is lower than it opened), then the body is usually coloured either black or red.  Candlestick Charts are great for detecting and predicting market trends over time and are useful for interpreting the day-to-day sentiment of the market, through each candlestick symbol's colouring and shape.  For example, the longer the body is, the more intense the selling or buying pressure is.  While, a very short body, would indicate that there is very little price movement in that time period and represents consolidation.  Candlestick Charts help reveal the market psychology (the fear and greed experienced by sellers and buyers) through the various indicators, such as shape and colour, but also by the many identifiable patterns that can be found in Candlestick Charts.  In total, there are 42 recognised patterns that are divided into simple and complex patterns.  These patterns found in Candlestick Charts are useful for displaying price relationships and can be used for predicting the possible future movement of the market.  You can find a list and description of each pattern here.  Please bear in mind, that Candlestick Charts don't express the events taking place between the open and close price - only the relationship between the two prices.  So you can't tell how volatile trading was within that single time period.

The y-axis on an OHLC Chart is used for the price scale, while the x-axis is the timescale. On each single time period, an OHLC Chart plots a symbol that represents two ranges: the highest and lowest prices traded, and also the opening and closing price on that single time period (for example in a day). On the range symbol, the high and low price ranges are represented by the length of the main vertical line. The open and close prices are represented by the vertical positioning of tick-marks that appear on the left (representing the open price) and on right (representing the close price) sides of the high-low vertical line.   Colour can be assigned to each OHLC Chart symbol, to distinguish whether the market is "bullish" (the closing price is higher than it opened) or "bearish" (the closing price is lower than it opened).

Used to display the general levels of supply and demand of a particular asset by visualising the price actions through a series of line patterns. Kagi Charts are time-independent and help filter out the noise that can occur on other financial charts (like on a Candlestick Chart). This is so that important price movements are displayed more clearly. Recognising the patterns that occur in Kagi Charts is key to understanding them.While Kagi Charts do display dates or time on their x-axis, these are in fact markers for the key price action dates and are not part of a timescale. The y-axis on the right-hand side is used as the value scale.  The line in a Kagi Chart initially moves vertically in the same direction of the price movement and will continue to extend, so long as the price, regardless of how small, maintains the same direction. Once the price hits a pre-determined “reversal” amount, the line makes a u-turn and goes in the opposite direction. So, each of the little horizontal lines on the chart indicates where a price reversal has taken place. When a horizontal line joins a rising line with a plunging line it’s known as a “shoulder”, while a horizontal line connecting a plunging line with a rising line is known as a “waist”.  The varying thickness or colour of the line is dependent on the price behaviour. When the price goes higher than a previous "shoulder" reversal, the line becomes thicker (and/or green) and is known as a "Yang line". This can be interpreted as an increase in demand over supply for the asset and as a bullish upward trend. Alternatively, when the price breaks below a previous "waist" reversal, the line becomes thinner (and/or red) and is known as a "Yin line".  This signifies an increase in supply over demand for the asset and as a bearish downward price trend.  Traders use the shift from thin (Yin) to thick (Yang) lines (and vice versa) as signals to buy or sell an asset. A Yin to Yang shift indicates to buy, while a Yang to Yin shift indicates to sell.

<!--

A Violin Plot is used to visualise the distribution of the data and its probability density.This chart is a combination of a Box Plot and a Density Plot that is rotated and placed on each side (to show the distribution shape of the data). The white dot in the middle is the median value and the thick black bar in the centre represents the interquartile range. The thin black line extending from it represents the upper (max) and lower (min) adjacent values in the data. Sometimes the graph marker is clipped from the end of this line.  Box Plots are limited in their display of the data, as their visual simplicity tends to hide significant details about how values in the data are distributed. For example, with Box Plots, you can't see if the distribution is bimodal or multimodal.  While Violin Plots display more information, they can be visually noisier than Box Plots.

- Functions: Distribution,Reference Tool
- Related Dataviz: Tally Chart

<!--

Also known as a Stemplot, Stem & Leaf Display.Stem & Leaf Plots are a way of organising data via their place value to show the distribution of data. Place values are shown ascending downwards on a "stem" column, typically but not always in tens. Data that is within each place value is listed and extends sideways from it as a "leaf".So in a dataset of (4,11,2,20,17,23) the data would be arranged based on their 10's digit but have only their 1's digit displayed:0  - 2, 410 - 1, 720 - 0, 3As well as giving readers a quick overview of the data distribution, Stem & Leaf Plots are useful for highlighting outliers and finding the mode. Displaying the data (mostly) raw makes Stem & Leaf Plots useful as a reference tool, such as a public transport schedule. If you have two datasets, then a back-to-back or double Stem & Leaf Plot can be used to compare the two datasets together.In terms of weaknesses, Stem & Leaf Plots are limited in the size of the dataset they can handle. Too little and they become pointless, too much and the chart becomes over-cluttered.

Data that is within each place value is listed and extends sideways from it as a "leaf".So in a dataset of (4,11,2,20,17,23) the data would be arranged based on their 10's digit but have only their 1's digit displayed:0  - 2, 410 - 1, 720 - 0, 3As well as giving readers a quick overview of the data distribution, Stem & Leaf Plots are useful for highlighting outliers and finding the mode. Displaying the data (mostly) raw makes Stem & Leaf Plots useful as a reference tool, such as a public transport schedule. If you have two datasets, then a back-to-back or double Stem & Leaf Plot can be used to compare the two datasets together.In terms of weaknesses, Stem & Leaf Plots are limited in the size of the dataset they can handle. Too little and they become pointless, too much and the chart becomes over-cluttered.

## Error Bars

<!--

Although not a chart outright, Error Bars function as a graphical enhancement that visualises the variability of the plotted data on a Cartesian graph. Error Bars can be applied to graphs such as Scatterplots, Dot Plots, Bar Charts or Line Graphs, to provide an additional layer of detail on the presented data.Error Bars help to indicate estimated error or uncertainty to give a general sense of how precise a measurement is. This is done through the use of markers drawn over the original graph and its data points. Typically, Error bars are used to display either the standard deviation, standard error, confidence intervals or the minimum and maximum values in a ranged dataset.  To visualise this information, Error Bars work by drawing cap-tipped lines that extend from the centre of the plotted data point (or edge with Bar Charts). The length of an Error Bar helps reveal the uncertainty of a data point: a short Error Bar shows that values are concentrated, signalling that the plotted average value is more likely, while a long Error Bar would indicate that the values are more spread out and less reliable. Also depending on the type of data, the length of each pair of Error Bars tend to be of equal length on both sides. However, if the data is skewed, then the lengths on each side would be unbalanced.  Error Bars always run parallel to a quantitative scale axis, so they can be displayed either vertically or horizontally, depending on whether the quantitative scale is on the Y or X axis. If there are two quantitative scales, then two pairs of Error Bars can be used for both axes.

## Point & Figure Chart

<img src="https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/images/top_images/SVG/point_and_figure_chart.svg" style="max-height: 100%" />

- Functions: Patterns
- Related Dataviz: Kagi Chart

<!--

Also known as a P&F Chart.This chart is used to display the relationship between the supply and demand of a particular asset through a series of columns made up of Xs and Os. Point & Figure Charts are time-independent and focus primarily on an asset's filtered price actions. Point & Figure Charts do not plot the volume traded and their purpose is to indicate any supply and demand relationship changes, which are known as "breakouts". Point & Figure Charts also make it easier to detect support and resistance levels, and any trend lines that may exist. Recognising the patterns that occur in Point & Figure Charts is key to utilising them.  While Point & Figure Charts do display dates or time on their x-axis, these are in-fact markers for the key price action dates and are not part of a time scale. The y-axis is used as the value scale. The Xs represent rising prices, where demand overtakes supply (more buyers) and the Os represent falling prices, where supply overtakes demand (more sellers).  Before drawing a Point & Figure Chart, you first need to decide on the values you want to set for the box size and the reversal amount.  You also need to choose, from what time point you want to take the price changes: this could be the day's closing price or it could be the day's high or low depending on the direction of the previous column.  The box size determines how much the price needs to change before a new X or O symbol can be placed. This sets how much noise in the market you want to filter out of the chart by reducing the number of minute price fluctuations displayed. So for example, if you set the box size to $1, any price increases or decreases less than this amount will be ignored, but if the price change is equal to or over $1, then a symbol will be placed on the chart.  These price changes are kept in one direction (either rising or falling) within a single column, and a single column can only contain either Xs or Os, not both. So if the price is on a rising uptrend (with Xs) then only Xs will be plotted in a column (this includes both price increases and decreases). It's only once the predetermined reversal amount is hit that a new column can be started. So if you had a column of Xs and your reversal amount is $3, if a price drop of $3 or more occurs then you need to start a new column of Os to indicate that the direction of the market has changed into a declining trend. The same thing with a column of Os, if the price increases by $3, then the trend has reversed from falling to rising, and you can now plot on a new column.  The reversal amount affects the sensitivity of the chart: a smaller reversal amount would yield more price fluctuations, making the chart wider and providing more information on what has occurred in the markets. However, a larger reversal amount would filter out insignificant price fluctuations, condensing the chart.  Numbers are sometimes also displayed in columns to indicate the start of a new month. 1-9 are used to denote January (1) through to September (9) and A, B and C are used for October (A), November (B) and December (C).

- Functions: Comparisons,Distribution,Flow,Processes & Methods,Proportions
- Related Dataviz: Sankey Diagram,Parallel Coordinates Plot

<!--

Parallel Sets are similar to  Sankey Diagrams in the way they show flow and proportions. However, Parallel Sets don’t use arrows and they divide the flow-path at each displayed line set.Each line set corresponds to a dimension, and its values and categories are represented in each line divide in that line set. The width of each line and the flow path that stems from it is determined by the proportional fraction of the category total. Each flow path can be coloured to show and compare the distribution between different categories.- - -The development process of Parallel Sets can be found in Robert Kosara's papers:  Turning a Table into a Tree: Growing Parallel Sets into a Purposeful Project  Parallel Sets: Interactive Exploration and Visual Analysis of Categorical Data

## Radial Bar Chart

- Functions: Comparisons
- Related Dataviz: Bar Chart,Radial Column Chart

<!--

A Radial Bar Chart is essentially a Bar Chart plotted on a polar coordinates system, rather than on a Cartesian one.The problem with Radial Bar Charts is that the bar lengths can be misleading. Each bar on the outside gets relatively longer than the previous bar, even if they represent the same value. This is because each bar is at a different radii.Since our visual systems are better at interpreting straight lines, a regular Bar Chart is a better choice for comparing values. The main reason to use a Radial Bar Chart instead is aesthetic.

## Proportional Area Chart

<img src="https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/images/top_images/area_chart.png" style="max-height: 100%" />

- Functions: Comparisons,Proportions
- Related Dataviz: Bubble Chart

<!--
 This chart is great for comparing values and showing proportions (in sizes, quantities, etc.) to give a quick, overall view of the relative sizes in the data, without using scales.  Proportional Area Charts usually use squares or circles. However, any shape can be used, so long as you use the shape’s area to represent the data. A common technical error with area charts is using length or height to determine the shape’s size. Instead, you need to calculate the space inside the shape (its area) to determine the size. Otherwise, you will cause exponential increases and decreases.  The downside to Proportional Area Charts is that they're difficult to accurately estimate values from. Therefore, they are typically used for presentational purposes rather than analysis.  More Proportional Area Chart variations in this blog post.

## Bullet Graph

<img src="https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/images/top_images/SVG/bullet_graph.svg" style="max-height: 100%" />

- Functions: Comparisons,Ranges
- Related Dataviz: Bar Chart

<!--

Used typically to display performance data, a Bullet Graph functions like a Bar Chart, but is accompanied by extra visual elements to pack in more context. Originally, Bullet Graphs were developed by Stephen Few as an alternative to dashboard gauges and meters, because they often displayed not enough information, were less space-efficient and were cluttered with "chartjunk".In a Bullet Graph, the main data value is encoded by length with the bar in the centre of the chart, which is known as the Feature Measure. The line marker that runs perpendicular to the orientation of the graph is known as the Comparative Measure and is used as a target marker to compare against the Feature Measure value. So if the main bar has passed the position of Comparative Measure, you know you've hit your goal.  The segmented coloured bars behind the Feature Measure are used to display qualitative range scores. Each colour shade (the three shades of grey in the example above) are used to assign a performance range rating. So for example, poor, average and great. When using Bullet Graphs, it's ideal to keep the maximum number of performance ranges to five.  - - -  You can find out more on Bullet Graphs in Stephen Few's guide: Bullet Graph Design Specification

## Box and Whisker Plot

- Functions: Distribution,Range,Comparisons,Patterns
- Related Dataviz: Span Chart,Violin Plot

<!--

A Box and Whisker Plot (or Box Plot) is a convenient way of visually displaying the data distribution through their quartiles.The lines extending parallel from the boxes are known as the “whiskers”, which are used to indicate variability outside the upper and lower quartiles. Outliers are sometimes plotted as individual dots that are in-line with whiskers. Box Plots can be drawn either vertically or horizontally.Although Box Plots may seem primitive in comparison to a Histogram or Density Plot, they have the advantage of taking up less space, which is useful when comparing distributions between many groups or datasets.Here are the types of observations one can make from viewing a Box Plot:
What the key values are, such as: the average, median, 25th percentile, etc.If there are any outliers and what their values are.If the data is symmetrical or not.How tightly is the data grouped.If the data is skewed and if so, in what direction.
Two of the most commonly used variation of Box Plot are: variable-width Box Plots and notched Box Plots.  You can find more on Box Plot variations in this blog post.

- Functions: Comparisons,Relationships,Patterns
- Related Dataviz: Parallel Sets,Radar Chart

<!--

This type of visualisation is used for plotting multivariate, numerical data. Parallel Coordinates Plots are ideal for comparing many variables together and seeing the relationships between them. For example, if you had to compare an array of products with the same attributes (comparing computer or car specs across different models).In a Parallel Coordinates Plot, each variable is given an axis and all the axes are placed parallel to each other. Each axis can have a different scale, as each variable works off a different unit of measurement, or all the axes can be normalised to keep all the scales uniform. Values are plotted as a series of lines that are connected across all the axes. This means that each line is a collection of points placed on each axis, that have all been connected.  The order the axes are arranged can impact the way how the reader understands the data. One reason for this is that the relationships between adjacent variables are easier to perceive than for non-adjacent variables. So re-ordering the axes can help in discovering patterns or correlations across variables.  The downside to Parallel Coordinates Plots, is that they can become over-cluttered and therefore, illegible when they’re very data-dense. The best way to remedy this problem is through interactivity and a technique known as “brushing”. Brushing highlights a selected line or collection of lines while fading out all the others. This allows you to isolate sections of the plot you’re interested in while filtering out the noise.
