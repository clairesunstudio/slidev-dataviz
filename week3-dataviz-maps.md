## Flow Map

- Functions: Distribution,Location,Movement & Flow

<!--

Flow Maps geographically show the movement of information or objects from one location to another and their amount. Typically Flow Maps are used to show the migration data of people, animals and products. The magnitude or amount of migration in a single flow line is represented by its thickness. This helps to show how migration is distributed geographically.Flow Maps are drawn from a point of origin and branch out of their “flow lines”. Arrows can be used to show direction, or if the movement is incoming or outgoing. Drawing flow lines without arrows can be used to represent trade going back-and-forth. Merging/bundling flow lines together and avoiding crossovers can help to reduce visual clutter on the map.

- Functions: Distribution,Location,Movement,Patterns,Relationships
- Related Dataviz: Flow Map

<!--

Also known as a Link Map or Ray Map.Connection Maps are drawn by connecting points placed on a map by straight or curved lines.While Connection Maps are great for showing connections and relationships geographically, they can also be used to display map routes through a single chain of links. Connection Maps can also be useful in revealing spatial patterns through the distribution of connections or by how concentrated connections are on a map.

- Functions: Distribution,Location,Patterns
- Related Dataviz: Bubble Map

<!--

Also known as a Point Map, Dot Distribution Map, Dot Density Map.Dot Maps are a way of detecting spatial patterns or the distribution of data over a geographical region, by placing equally sized points over a geographical region.There are two types of Dot Map: one-to-one (one point represents a single count or object) and one-to-many (one point represents a particular unit, e.g. 1 point = 10 trees).  Dot Maps are ideal for seeing how things are distributed over a geographical region and can reveal patterns when the points cluster on the map.  Dot Maps are easy to grasp and are better at giving an overview of the data, but are not great for retrieving exact values.

- Functions: Location,Proportions
- Related Dataviz: Dot Map,Proportional Area Chart

<!--

With this data map, circles are displayed over a designated geographical region with the area of each circle being proportional to its value in the dataset.Bubble Maps are good for comparing proportions over geographic regions without the issues caused by regional area size, as seen on Choropleth Maps. However, a major flaw with Bubble Maps is that overly large bubbles can overlap other bubbles and regions on the map, so this needs to be accounted for.

## Choropleth Map

- Functions: Comparisons,Location,Patterns

<!--

Choropleth Maps display divided geographical areas or regions that are coloured, shaded or patterned in relation to a data variable. This provides a way to visualise values over a geographical area, which can show variation or patterns across the displayed location.The data variable uses colour progression to represent itself in each region of the map. Typically, this can be a blending from one colour to another, a single hue progression, transparent to opaque, light to dark or an entire colour spectrum.One downside to the use of colour is that you can't accurately read or compare values from the map. Another issue is that larger regions appear more emphasised then smaller ones, so the viewer's perception of the shaded values are affected.A common error when producing Choropleth Maps is to encode raw data values (such as population) rather than using normalized values (calculating population per square kilometre for example) to produce a density map.
