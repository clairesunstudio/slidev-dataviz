## Case Study (Data Visualization)
1 dataset 100 visualizations, which works and which doesn't?

<a href="https://100.datavizproject.com/property/length/">![1 dataset 100 dataviz](/images/week7/100dataviz.png)</a>

<!-- A project by Ferdio, a leading infographic and data visualization agency specialized in transforming data and information into captivating visuals, based in Denmark 

Some work well, some don't, some violates the design principles we learned
Let's take a look and use our knowledge to crique some of the data visualization in this collection.

Common theme: interactive storytelling
Dynamic arc graph/Dot matrix/isotype chart/pictogram

This data interactive from The Washington Post explores mass shootings in the United States over the past 60 years. Mass shootings occur when four or more individuals are killed, which has happened 189 times in the U.S. since the 1960s. Details about each of these shootings can be viewed, including visual representations of the number of victims, types of firearms used, as well as shooter information. Users can also explore a graph that visualizes the death toll and frequency of U.S. mass shootings over time, along with interactive maps breaking down mass shootings by settingâ€”including schools, offices, places of worship, and others. -->
