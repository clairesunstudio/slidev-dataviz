Dynamic arc graph/Dot matrix/isotype chart/pictogram

This data interactive from The Washington Post explores mass shootings in the United States over the past 60 years. Mass shootings occur when four or more individuals are killed, which has happened 189 times in the U.S. since the 1960s. Details about each of these shootings can be viewed, including visual representations of the number of victims, types of firearms used, as well as shooter information. Users can also explore a graph that visualizes the death toll and frequency of U.S. mass shootings over time, along with interactive maps breaking down mass shootings by settingâ€”including schools, offices, places of worship, and others. -->
