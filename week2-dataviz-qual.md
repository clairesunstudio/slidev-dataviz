<!--
 A Venn Diagram is a diagram that visually displays the logical relationships between a collection of sets. Each set is typically represented with a circle. Contained within each set is a collection of objects or charateristics.

<!--
When sets overlap, itâ€™s known as the intersection area. This is where entities are in common between the overlapping sets.The example on this page is of a 2-set Venn Diagram. However, there are also 3, 4, 5, 6 sets, multi-set Venn Diagrams, which display a more complex geometry between sets.

## Flow Chart

<!--

Also known as Flow Diagram, Flow Process Chart, Process Chart, Process Map, Process Model, Work Flow Diagram.This type of diagram is used to show the sequential steps of a process.  Flow Charts map out a process using a series of connected symbols, which makes the process easy to understand and aids in its communication to other people.  Flow Charts are useful for explaining how a complex and/or abstract procedure, system, concept or algorithm work.  Drawing a Flow Chart can also help in planning and developing a process or improving an existing one.  Symbols are divided up and standardised into different types that each have their own particular shape. Labels for each step are written inside of the symbol shape. Flow Charts begin and end with a curved rectangle to signify the start and finishing of the process. Lines or arrows are used to show the direction of flow from one step in the process to another. Simple instructions or actions are represented by a rectangle. While a diamond shape is used when a decision is needed. There are also many other symbols that can be used in a Flow Chart.  Flow Charts can run horizontally or vertically.

## Tree Diagram

- Functions: Hierarchy,Reference Tool,Relationships
- Related Dataviz: 

<!--

Also known as a Organisational chart, Linkage Tree.A Tree Diagram is a way of visually representing hierarchy in a tree-like structure. Typically the structure of a Tree Diagram consists of elements such as a root node, a member that has no superior/parent. Then there are the nodes, which are linked together with line connections called branches that represent the relationships and connections between the members. Finally, the leaf nodes (or end-nodes) are members who have no children or child nodes.Tree Diagrams are often used:
To show family relations and descent.In taxonomy, the practice and science of classification.In evolutionary science, to show the origin of species.In computer science and mathematics.In businesses and organisations for managerial purposes.

## Network Diagram

<!--

Also known as Network Graph, Network Map, Node-Link Diagram.This type of visualisation shows how things are interconnected through the use of nodes and link lines to represent their connections and help illuminate the type of relationships between a group of entities.  Typically, nodes are drawn as little dots or circles, but icons can also be used. Links are usually displayed as simple lines connected between the nodes. However, in some Network Diagrams, not all of the nodes and links are created equally: additional variables can be visualised, for example, by making the node size or link stroke weight proportion to an assigned value.  By mapping out connected systems, Network Diagrams can be used to interpret the structure of a network by looking for any clustering of the nodes, how densely nodes are connected or how the diagram layout is arranged.  The two notable types of Network Diagrams are "undirected" and "directed". Undirected Network Diagrams only display the connections between entities, while directed Network Diagrams show if the connections are one-way or two-way through small arrows.  Network Diagrams have a limited data capacity and start to become hard to read when there are too many nodes and resemble "hairballs".

- Functions: Patterns,Relationships
- Related Dataviz: Network Diagram

<!--
 Arc Diagrams are an alternate way of representing two- dimensional Network Diagrams. In Arc Diagrams, nodes are placed along a single line (a one-dimensional axis) and arcs are used to show connections between those nodes.  The thickness of each arc line can be used to represent frequency between the source and target node. Arc Diagrams can be useful in finding the co-occurrence within the data.  The downside to Arc Diagrams is they don't show structure and connections between nodes as well as 2D charts do and too many links can make the diagram hard to read due to clutter.  - - -   Combining Arc Diagrams with other visualisations.Academic research done on Arc Diagrams.

- Related Dataviz: Non-ribbon Chord Diagram

<!--

This type of diagram visualises the inter-relationships between entities. The connections between entities are used to display that they share something in common. This makes Chord Diagrams ideal for comparing the similarities within a dataset or between different groups of data.Nodes are arranged along a circle, with the relationships between points connected to each other either through the use of arcs or BÃ©zier curves. Values are assigned to each connection, which is represented proportionally by the size of each arc. Colour can be used to group the data into different categories, which aids in making comparisons and distinguishing groups.Over-cluttering becomes an issue with Chord Diagrams when there are too many connections displayed.

Sankey Diagrams display flows and their quantities in proportion to one another. Typically, Sankey Diagrams are used to visually represent the transfer of energy, money, materials, or the flow of any isolated system or process.The thickness of the arrows and lines shows their magnitudes or quantities. Flow arrows or lines can combine or split apart at each stage of a process.Colour can be used to divide the diagram into different categories or to show the transition from one state of the process to another.Often, Sankey Diagrams are confused with Parallel Sets and Alluvial Diagrams, but this post clarifies the differences.

## Word Cloud

- Functions: Analysing Text,Distribution / Frequency,Proportions

<!--

Also known as aTag Cloud.  A visualisation method that displays how frequently words appear in a given body of text, by making the size of each word proportional to its frequency. All the words are then arranged in a cluster or cloud of words. Alternatively, the words can also be arranged in any format: horizontal lines, columns or within a shape.Word Clouds can also be used to display words that have meta-data assigned to them. For example, in a Word Cloud of all the World's countries, the population could be assigned to each country's name to determine its size.Colour used on Word Clouds is usually meaningless and is primarily aesthetic, but it can be used to categorise words or to display another data variable.Typically, Word Clouds are used on websites or blogs to depict keyword or tag usage. Word Clouds can also be used to compare two different bodies of text together.Although simple and easy to understand, Word Clouds have some major flaws:Long words are emphasised over short words.  Words whose letters contain many ascenders and descenders may receive more attention.  They're not great for analytical accuracy, so used more for aesthetic reasons instead.
