<!--

Also known as a Point Map, Dot Distribution Map, Dot Density Map.Dot Maps are a way of detecting spatial patterns or the distribution of data over a geographical region, by placing equally sized points over a geographical region.There are two types of Dot Map: one-to-one (one point represents a single count or object) and one-to-many (one point represents a particular unit, e.g. 1 point = 10 trees).  Dot Maps are ideal for seeing how things are distributed over a geographical region and can reveal patterns when the points cluster on the map.  Dot Maps are easy to grasp and are better at giving an overview of the data, but are not great for retrieving exact values.

<!--

Also known as a Link Map or Ray Map.Connection Maps are drawn by connecting points placed on a map by straight or curved lines.While Connection Maps are great for showing connections and relationships geographically, they can also be used to display map routes through a single chain of links. Connection Maps can also be useful in revealing spatial patterns through the distribution of connections or by how concentrated connections are on a map.

<!--

Flow Maps geographically show the movement of information or objects from one location to another and their amount. Typically Flow Maps are used to show the migration data of people, animals and products. The magnitude or amount of migration in a single flow line is represented by its thickness. This helps to show how migration is distributed geographically.Flow Maps are drawn from a point of origin and branch out of their “flow lines”. Arrows can be used to show direction, or if the movement is incoming or outgoing. Drawing flow lines without arrows can be used to represent trade going back-and-forth. Merging/bundling flow lines together and avoiding crossovers can help to reduce visual clutter on the map.

- Functions: Location,Proportions

<!--

With this data map, circles are displayed over a designated geographical region with the area of each circle being proportional to its value in the dataset.Bubble Maps are good for comparing proportions over geographic regions without the issues caused by regional area size, as seen on Choropleth Maps. However, a major flaw with Bubble Maps is that overly large bubbles can overlap other bubbles and regions on the map, so this needs to be accounted for.

## Choropleth Map

- Functions: Comparisons,Location,Patterns
- Related Dataviz: Heatmap

<!--

Choropleth Maps display divided geographical areas or regions that are coloured, shaded or patterned in relation to a data variable. This provides a way to visualise values over a geographical area, which can show variation or patterns across the displayed location.The data variable uses colour progression to represent itself in each region of the map. Typically, this can be a blending from one colour to another, a single hue progression, transparent to opaque, light to dark or an entire colour spectrum.One downside to the use of colour is that you can't accurately read or compare values from the map. Another issue is that larger regions appear more emphasised then smaller ones, so the viewer's perception of the shaded values are affected.A common error when producing Choropleth Maps is to encode raw data values (such as population) rather than using normalized values (calculating population per square kilometre for example) to produce a density map.

## Choropleth Map VS. Heat Map

<img src="/images/week6/choropleth_heatmap.png" style="max-height: 100%" />

<!-- 
https://www.standardco.de/notes/heatmaps-vs-choropleths
When it comes to using maps for data visualization, the term heatmap is used rather loosely. (We've looked at heatmap example as a colored matrix, a grid of colored cells, that allows you to glance at and quickly tell which pairings have a high or low rate of occurrence or correlation. It's much easier to scan for dark or light patches than to assess numeric values) It also can be used to describe any map that uses colors to categorize location based data. which might sound similar to choropleth maps. However there is a distinction between geographic heatmaps and choropleth maps. Let's compare...

Choropleths are thematic maps where a geographic region has a uniform color based on a metric. A color scale is used to encode a range of values. These are often called heatmaps, but that isn't entirely accurate. The key difference between choropleth maps and heat maps is the shape of colored areas. In choropleths, shapes are defined by standard geographical boundaries, not by the data itself. A true geographic heatmap is an isopleth map (has data drawn shapes) that depict hotspots on a map to present concentrations of values.

Presenting GDP by country would be a good use case for a choropleth because the values would be directly tied to political boundaries. Using a heatmap for average rainfall would be a good fit because rain is not influenced by borders. -->

Pros:
– Can effectively be used to report area values at virtually any scale, from global to local – and the data can be thought about in many different ways at many different levels of analysis, from general overall patterns to the detection of details.
– Helpful for finding intriguing hot spots, detecting relationships between the encoded variable and geographic location (and the many variables entangled with location), or letting people know how their area compares with others.

Cons:
– Since the choropleth map uses an average number to represent defined areas, the viewer can not gain detailed information or perspective on any area’s internal conditions. This can be solved by making the map interactive

– Layering data onto a geographical space that we are familiar with, a problem with that is the areas are not uniform: principle - visual importance should be directly proportionate to data values. For example, for population data, ,equating the visual importance of each county with its geographic area rather than with the number of people living in there, giving sparsely populated areas great visual emphasis. This can be solved by using the method of grid-square mapping (dividing the map into equal sized units/squares and then color each one according to the data being encoded). A grid cartogram is a representation barely similar to a map, that distorts the forms and areas, and assigns to every subdivision one and only one unit of a grid. There are other types of cartogram that basically distorts the areas based on the data values. 

The Dorling Cartogram is a technique for representing data for areas that eschews geography in preference for (normally) a geometric shape that represents the unit areas.
