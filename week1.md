# What Is Data Visualization

<quote> The visual display of quantitative information</quote> 
â€” Edward Tufte

# Why Visualize Data

Explore, analyze, and communicate patterns and insights 
- Analyze patterns and trends
- Make data-drive/evidence-based decision
- Make complex data more accessible and digestible to their audience
-  Common data visualizations include tables, charts, graphs, and dashboards.

## Qualitative
- Data that approximates or characterizes
- Often obtained through interviews, surveys, focus groups, documents, etc.
- Examples include:
  - name
  - sex (male, female, nonbinary)
  - observations (e.g., the food was salty)

::right::

## Quantitative
- Data that is measurable and expressed as a number
- Often gathered using metrics, tests, experiments, instruments with a ratings scale, etc.
- Examples include: 
  - cost
  - number of applicants
  - weight

## Discrete
- Data that can only take certain values

Examples include:
  - the cost of a BMW 7-series
  - your shoe size
  - number of people enrolled in this course

::right::

## Continuous
- Data that can take any value and usually changes over time

Examples include:
  - the speed of a car during the morning commute
  - your weight
  - the time your cat wakes up each day

# Data Analysis
<br/>

## Exploratory
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is the process of reviewing new data to discover patterns, to spot anomalies, to test hypotheses, and to check assumptions.


## Explanatory
- We also use data visualization to transform raw data into something compelling for an external audience.

# Demo

---

# Observable
- All-in-one-place: code, data and visualization, running environment
- Open-source: Leverage common coding languages and open-source libraries, most flexible, always have access to your creations, works are transparent, free

- Notebook: web-based interactive canvases where you can combine data, code, and interaction
- Cell: content blocks - add content in **Markdown**, **JavaScript**, SQL, or HTML.
